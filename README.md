# Wandergram
Wandergram is an app clone of Instagram.

This mini project showcases my knowledge with essential CSS concept that I learned.

From making the:
-header position: sticky; so that it doesn't scroll down together with the contents.

-making the container's overflow: hidden; overflow-y: auto or scroll; so that to have a mobile responsivve effects.

-enforcing knowledge about display: properties of the css that really helps with styling the contents of the project.
